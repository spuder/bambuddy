"""Batch order planning: per-plate targets, progress, and staged dispatch (#342).

A batch stores *intent* in :class:`PrintBatchPlate` rows — "this order wants 3
of plate 2" — while its queue items record what was actually dispatched.
Everything here derives one from the other.

The distinction matters for exactly one reason, and it is the reason the
feature exists: a failed or cancelled run does not count towards the target, so
``remaining`` goes back up and the order still says it owes a print. A design
that only counted the items it created could not tell "the user cancelled this
deliberately" apart from "this one burned and needs reprinting".

Batches created before targets existed have no plate rows. They still report
progress — the plate breakdown is derived from their queue items and every
target simply equals the number of items dispatched, so ``remaining`` is zero
and the dispatch endpoint has nothing to do. ``has_targets`` tells callers
which kind of batch they are looking at.
