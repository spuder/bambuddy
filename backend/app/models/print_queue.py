class PrintQueueVariant(Base):
    """One candidate file for a queue item that may print on several models (#671).

    A user with an H2S and an H2C slices the same job twice and does not care
    which machine runs it. Each slice becomes a variant; the scheduler walks them
    in ``position`` order and takes the first whose model has an idle printer.

    **This is a snapshot, not a pointer.** The candidate list is copied from the
    library's variant group when the item is queued, and every per-file setting
    the dispatcher needs is copied with it. Two reasons:

    - Editing the library group afterwards must not silently change a job that is
      already waiting in the queue.
    - The per-file settings genuinely differ between candidates and are choices
      the user made for *this* job, not properties of the file. An H2C slice is
      dual-nozzle and will not have the same slot count, AMS mapping or nozzle
      mapping as the H2S slice of the same model.

    On a match the winning variant's fields are written onto the queue row before
    the dispatch commit, so everything downstream — upload, archive creation,
    print history, reprint — sees an ordinary single-file item and needs no
    knowledge that variants exist.

    Variants reference library files only. An archive records a print that already
    happened, of one specific file, so it is never a candidate for "which of these
    should we run".
